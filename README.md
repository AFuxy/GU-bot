## Setting up
1. When first installing make sure to run `npm install` that will install all the packages for the application
2. Then you want to create a `.env` file and then put this in the file

```env
TOKEN=
SERVERID=
SUGGESTID=
AUDITID=
STAFFROLE=
```
> Optional for your .env if "DEBUG" currently does nothing but in the future will provide more info for crashes

3. After that, run `npm start`
