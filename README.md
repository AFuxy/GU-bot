## Setting up
1. When first installing make sure to run `npm install` that will install all the packages for the application
2. Then you want to create a `.env` file and then put this in the file

```env
TOKEN=
SERVERID=
SUGGESTID=
AUDITID=
STAFFROLE=
DEBUG=true
```
> little note leave DEBUG as true if you want to use the game options as for some reason they don't work on public commands

3. After that, run `npm start`
